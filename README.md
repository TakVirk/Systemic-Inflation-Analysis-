# Systemic-Inflation-Analysis-

This project explores the relationship between systemic inflammation—measured via C-reactive protein (CRP)—and a range of demographic, behavioral, and nutritional factors in U.S. adults. Using data from the 2021–2023 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), I applied both multiple linear regression and Random Forest modeling to identify key predictors of inflammation.
